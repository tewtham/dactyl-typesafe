## Parts list
1. [nylon 8mm ball transfer units](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32839736943.html) * 3 for the trackball.
1. [non-slip mat](https://www.amazon.com/ROOS-Self-Stick-Anti-Skid-Furniture-Protectors/dp/B01K7JFXAA)
1. 34mm ball
    - Any 34mm ball will probably work, but I think it's best to use [a replacement trackball](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000351102541.html). You will get better response and precision.
1. [pmw3360 laser sensor board](https://www.tindie.com/products/jkicklighter/pmw3360-motion-sensor/)
1. 2 * [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) boards.
1. a dualshock style joystick
    - I had pretty good luck cutting out the joysticks from a broken ds4 someone gave me, but I think you can buy these new also.
1. M3 [heat set inserts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2255800878462496.html) and countersunk bolts
1. M2 nuts/bolts for the laser sensor
1. [jst connectors](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2255800221261384.html) for at least the thumb clusters (see [wiring](things/4x6-wireless/wiring.jpg))
1. A bunch of 95mm width metal plates (see [weights](things/4x6-wireless/weights.jpg))
1. Some batteries (I used some AA shaped ones so I can remove them)
